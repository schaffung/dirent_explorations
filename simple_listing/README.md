# Simple Listing.

Calling this similar to ls will be a grave mistake.

This code does one thing..i.e to take what's given to it ( hoping it is a 
directory ), and then opening the directory and printing what's inside it.

One can compile this code simply using `gcc simple_listing.c -o s_listing`

And can pass any number of arguments, but currently the code will only be 
taking the very first command line argument for consideration :p
